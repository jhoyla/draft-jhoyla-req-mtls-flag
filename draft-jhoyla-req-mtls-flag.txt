                        TLS Flag - Request mTLS

Abstract

   Normally in TLS there is no way for the client to signal to the
   server that it has been configured with a certificate suitable for
   mTLS.  This document defines a TLS Flag [I-D.ietf-tls-tlsflags]

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a TLS Flag that indicates to the server that
   the client supports mTLS.  Sometimes a server does not want to
   negotiate mTLS with every client, but might wish to authenticate a
   subset of them.  In TLS 1.3 this may be done with post-handshake
   auth, however this adds an extra round-trip, and requires negotiation
   at the application layer.  A client sending the request mTLS flag in
   the ClientHello allows the server to request authentication during
   the initial handshake only when it receives a hint the client
   supports it.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Flag specification

   A server receiving this flag MAY send a CertificateRequest message.

4.  Security Considerations

   This flag should have no effect on the security of TLS, as the server
   may always send a CertificateRequest message during the handshake.
   This flag merely provides a hint that the client will be able to
   fulfil the request.  If the client sets this flag but then fails to
   provide a certificate the server MAY terminate the connection with a
   bad_certificate error.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to add an entry to the TLS Flags registry
   in the TLS namespace with the following values:

   *  Value shall be TBD

   *  Flag Name shall be request_mtls.

   *  Message shall be CH

   *  Recommended shall be set to no (N)

   *  The reference shall be this document {!draft-jhoyla-req-mtls}
