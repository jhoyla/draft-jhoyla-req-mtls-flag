(maybe not just any old X.509 certificate blob with path building etc,  but perhaps something more limited or even a raw public key to encourage dedicated trust stores for this purpose?)\n\nOr is the intention here to be a generic \"it's safe to send me a certificate request\" that browsers/clients/things-not-bots could possibly start using for certain things - and leaving \"bot-auth\" to have to disambiguate the cases (i.e. what trust store to use) on the server by other means if both are in use. \n",
